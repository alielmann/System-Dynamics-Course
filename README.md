# System-Dynamics-Course
This course lays the basic of system dynamics. It starts with the basic terminology, continued with linear models (input-output model), modeling of rigid-body mechanical systems, solution method for dynamic models (Laplace transform, response types and stability, etc.), spring and damper elements in mechanical systems, block diagrams and state-variable models, electrical and electro-mechanical systems, fluid and thermal systems, response of first and second order systems.

This course uses Matlab and Simulink for the mechanical practice simulation
